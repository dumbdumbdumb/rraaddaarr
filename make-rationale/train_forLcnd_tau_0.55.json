I love scifi too which Star Wars (1977) is your favorite?\nuser:That's a really good one. Sarah Connor is such an amazing character. I just re-watched Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003) a couple of days ago. It feels so hollow without her in it. Arnold is the star, but Linda Hamilton is really what made The Terminator (1984) and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) such compelling films.\nrecommender:She honestly is in incredible through the whole thing\nuser:The original Star Wars (1977) is my favorite by far, but The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983) are wonderful too.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) was excellent, and I have high hopes for the upcoming Han Solo movie. Sorry, machete order?\nrecommender:so you do Star Wars (1977) then The Empire Strikes Back (1980) , Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008) Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith (2005) and end with Return of the Jedi (1983) it shifts the perspective in some fun ways\nuser:Interesting, I may have to do that. I have al of the Star Wars films on iTunes.\nrecommender:because 2 and three then become flashbacks in the original arc rather than their own messy stand alone thing\nuser:Oh! Clever!\nrecommender:its also just a fun way to kill a weekend if you don't have other plans\nuser:Hmmm I wonder how Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) would work as a flashback... after Star Wars (1977) the original?\n",
